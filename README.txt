Cena Data Transfer Agent 

NOTE: This is 0.3 branch. 
a frozen branch based on original Cena-DTA. 
new master branch will have different cena protocol,
and therefore incompatible with 0.3 branch. 

PHP/JavaScript framework for HTML5's local databases 
to synchronize database on client and server. 

Both data as well as relations can be transfered to server 
even if the relation uses auto-numbered primary key. 

Uses PHP5.3, MySQL, and jQuery.
